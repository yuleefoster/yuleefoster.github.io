							<h1>Destination Weddings and Honeymoons Abroad</h1>
							<p><i>2017</i><br>
							<br>
							I interned with DWHA Magazine for 3 months at the end of 2017, working on their January/February 2018 edition. I helped on some pages, as well as some adverts for clients.<br>
              <br>
              "Real Life Weddings" showcased different destination weddings from around the world. I tried to make sure that every detail from the wedding was included in the double page spread and that the pictures and layout flowed with their wedding day.</p>
              <span class="image main"><img src="images/dwha/dwha1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
              <p>Cover ups are a very popular option for brides during a winter wedding so we wanted to promote some of our favourite ones. I worked to group the different styles together and also to make it all cohesive. If I could re-do this page I would have added some more different styles - maybe longer options - since I did not get the opportunity to pick the styles.</p>
              <span class="image main"><img src="images/dwha/dwha2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
              <p>We had a massive feature on Wedding Planners for this issue. I was tasked to find an interesting way to display 50 Wedding Planners with their photo and a small description with each one. I tried a lot of different solutions from more absract ones to different columns and rows combinations. Finally, I came up with this layout, I thought it was a nice balance between structure to add all the images and words but still easy to read and an interesting page to look at.</p>
