							<h1>Destination Weddings and Honeymoons Abroad</h1>
							<p><i>2017</i><br>
							<br>
							I interned with DWHA Magazine for 3 months at the end of 2017, working on their January/February 2018 edition. I helped on some pages, as well as some adverts for clients.<br>
              <br>
              "Real Life Weddings" showcased different destination weddings from around the world. I tried to make sure that every detail from the wedding was included in the double page spread and that the pictures and layout flowed with their wedding day.</p>
              <span class="image main"><img src="images/dwha/dwha1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
              <p>Cover ups are a very popular option for brides during a winter wedding so we wanted to promote some of our favourite ones. I worked to group the different styles together and also to make it all cohesive. If I could re-do this page I would have added some more different styles - maybe longer options - since I did not get the opportunity to pick the styles.</p>
              <span class="image main"><img src="images/dwha/dwha2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
              <p>We had a massive feature on Wedding Planners for this issue. I was tasked to find an interesting way to display 50 Wedding Planners with their photo and a small description with each one. I tried a lot of different solutions from more absract ones to different columns and rows combinations. Finally, I came up with this layout, I thought it was a nice balance between structure to add all the images and words but still easy to read and an interesting page to look at.</p>
              <span class="image main"><img src="images/dwha/dwha3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I also was able to work on this spread in the March/April edition. The diamond shape was inspired by the shape of the cake and I really liked how they all fit together on the page. The biggest challenge for this page was figuring out how best to cut the images and then how to fit them all together.</p>
