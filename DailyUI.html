  								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
  									<h3>Thoughts</h3><p>These first two challenges were quite challenging as I found it hard to pick a theme or idea to work off. I decided on a Book Club theme, since reading is one of my New Year’s Resolutions. Initially, I wanted the main colour to more of a brownish red but I changed it to a dark pinky red colour since this would be my Book Club and want to cater to a more female audience. The card checkout is based on my favourite website checkout – ASOS. It is minimal, simplistic and easy to understand.<br><i>Made with Sketch</i></p>

  								</div>
  								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
  									<h3>Thoughts</h3><p>So many landing pages feature large, beautiful sweeping images as their main feature, but I wanted to try and make a landing page only using type. I, again, first chose the colours that I wanted to use. I loved this yellow that felt bordered on pastel yellow and neon yellow and then chose the soft blue for some slight contrast but I still wanted the two colours to feel harmonious together. I went for a simple idea of a gratitude journal and a definition to put on the landing page. <br>If I was to carry on with the whole page I think I would keep the yellow background throughout and maybe introduce a darker blue colour for blocks of text since I do not think the light blue colour would have enough contrast, making it hard to read.<br><i>Made with Sketch</i></p>

  								</div>
  								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
  									<h3>Thoughts</h3><p>For day 4 the prompt was a calculator. At first I wanted to make a retro calculator and had even picked out some colours to start with but, being a mathematician, my mind wandered to Abacus’. I have always found them fascinating. Beautiful, simplistic but quite clever piece of equipment. I made the app iPro size since I think an iPhone would be too small and it is probably not something you would use every day but something fun to play around with. I based the colours and style on a Chinese style of abacus, I don’t think the shadows are perfect but I wanted to try and add some dimension to them and I couldn’t quite think of an appropriate way to highlight.<br><i>Made with Sketch</i></p>
