							<p><i>2017 - 2019</i><br><br>
							AFRIL is a charity in Lewisham, London, working with refugees and asylum seekers to relieve poverty and social isolation. AFRIL continue to help people in the local community each week - with education through their Rainbow Club Saturday School, family support services, and access to emergency supplies. I have been volunteering with them to update their promotional material since they have recently updated their logo.</p>

							<h3><center>Leaflets</center></h3>
							<p>For my first project at AFRIL, I had to re-design their two main leaflets with their new updated logo.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/PhotoLeaflet1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/PhotoLeaflet2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>The information leaflet highlights all the services that they offer as well as where to find the charity. I wanted to make the leaflet clear and concise so anyone, even someone who does not understand English could understand what the AFRIL does. If I was to re-do the leaflet, I think I would have made the fonts a bit smaller and tightened it all up a little bit but since it was my first time ever doing a printed leaflet, I wanted to air on the side of caution and make the font size a bit bigger.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/2-1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/2-2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The second leaflet was targeted more to people that would want to volunteer and donate to the charity. For this leaflet, I focused more on providing information about the charity and what they do. If I was to revise this brochure I would try and find better suiting images. Ones that better reflected what it is like to volunteer for AFRIL and try and add more testimonies.</p>

							<h3><center>Annual Reports</center></h3>
							<p>I have also worked on designing AFRIL's last 2 Annual Reports. Because of how many projects AFRIL has, one of the main challenges I faced was keeping them down to a reasonable length (2016-2017 was 42 pages and 2017-2018 was 22 pages). This is to make sure all the information inside is concise and essential for what a reader would need to know. For me, what was most important in both reports was capturing the essence of the amazing work that AFRIL. I have tried to do this through pictures and highlighting case studies and quotes.</p>
