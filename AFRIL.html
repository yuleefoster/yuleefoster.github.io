							<h1>Action for Refugees in Lewisham</h1>
							<p><i>2017 - 2018</i><br><br>
							AFRIL is a charity in Lewisham, London, working with refugees and asylum seekers to relieve poverty and social isolation. AFRIL continue to help people in the local community each week - with education through their Rainbow Club Saturday School, family support services, and access to emergency supplies. I have been volunteering with them to update their promotional material since they have recently updated their logo.</p>
							<h2><center>Banner</center></h2>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="3u 12u$(medium)">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/afrilbanner.png" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="3u 12u$(medium)">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/afrilbanner1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>The banner needed an updated look with AFRILâ€™s new logo.<br><br>
									For the banner, I wanted a simpler style to their previous one. I did this by adding icons in place of text and added a solid background colour to break up different parts of the text.<br><br>
									I chose the green colour as a colour for growth, life and safety. The photo shows an activity at the Rainbow Club with one girl looking directly at the camera, I liked this picture as it felt inviting to whoever is seeing the banner.</p></div>

							<h3><center>Leaflets</center></h3></a>
							<p>For my first project at AFRIL, I had to re-design their two main leaflets with their new updated logo.</p>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/PhotoLeaflet1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/PhotoLeaflet2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>The information leaflet highlights all the services that they offer as well as where to find the charity. I wanted to make the leaflet clear and concise so anyone, even someone who does not understand English could understand what the AFRIL does. If I was to re-do the leaflet, I think I would have made the fonts a bit smaller and tightened it all up a little bit but since it was my first time ever doing a printed leaflet, I wanted to air on the side of caution and make the font size a bit bigger.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/2-1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/afril/2-2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The second leaflet was targeted more to people that would want to volunteer and donate to the charity. For this leaflet, I focused more on providing information about the charity and what they do. If I was to revise this brochure I would try and find better suiting images. Ones that better reflected what it is like to volunteer for AFRIL and try and add more testimonies.</p>
